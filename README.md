## Data Science Learning Portfolio
> This repository is a personal portfolio of my journey into the field of Data Science since 2025.
> I have a strong industry background across electronics and semiconductors with experience in business development and product delivery.
> Through Python and data projectes, I aim to transform domain knowledge into data-driven insights.

## Repository Structure

### `practice/` **[WIP]**  
> Categorized learning notebooks for foundational Python, data structures, and logic
- `basics/`: Core syntax - sequential statements, conditionals, input/output, f-strings, etc.
- `collections/`: Python collections - lists, dictionaries, tuples, and more
- `errors/`: Exception handling and error notes
- `files/`: File operations such as open, read, write
- `loops/`: Loop structures (for / while) and using parameters
- `reference/`: Helper functions, cheatsheets, and syntax reference
- `tools/`: Python introspection tools like `dir()`, `help()`, `type()`, etc.

### practice_sets  
> Mixed practice sets.  

### projects **[WIP]**  
> Mini data anaylysis projects with real-world or industry-inspired context (currently in planning).  
> - Planned folder for future data analysis projects.
> - Currently empty and not yet added to the repository.

### kaggle-projects **[WIP]**  
> Real-world machine learning projects from Kaggle competitions (in progress).  
This folder includes structured project folders for hands-on practice using real competition datasets.  


#### `titanic_survival_2025-07-18/`:  
My first Kaggle challenge: **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**
This project focuses on building predictive models to determine passenger survival on the Titanic.  

**Progress so far (first attempt - July 2025 - based on Kaggle tutorial)**:  
- Baseline model (`titanic_model_v1.ipynb`) built using **TensorFlow Decision Forests (TFDF)**
- Followed Kaggle's official tutorial as initial guidance
- Implemented ensemble strategy (100 trees, varied seeds)
- Successfully generated and submitted `submission.csv`
- Kaggle Public Score: **0.80622**

**Next steps**:
- Begin EDA (exploratory data analysis) to understand feature patterns
- Add engineered features (e.g., `Title`, `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`)
- Try alternative models (XGBoost, RandomForest)
- Apply validation techniques to avoid overfitting

More challenges will be added as I progress through my data science learning.

Thanks for visiting.  
I'll continue updating this portfolio with new learnings and projects.
