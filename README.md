## Data Science Learning Portfolio
> This repository is a personal portfolio of my journey into the field of Data Science since 2025.
> I have a strong industry background across electronics and semiconductors with experience in business development and product delivery.
> Through Python and data projectes, I aim to transform domain knowledge into data-driven insights.

## Repository Structure

### `practice/` **[WIP]**  
> Categorized learning notebooks for foundational Python, data structures, and logic
- `basics/`: Core syntax - sequential statements, conditionals, input/output, f-strings, etc.
- `collections/`: Python collections - lists, dictionaries, tuples, and more
- `errors/`: Exception handling and error notes
- `files/`: File operations such as open, read, write
- `loops/`: Loop structures (for / while) and using parameters
- `reference/`: Helper functions, cheatsheets, and syntax reference
- `tools/`: Python introspection tools like `dir()`, `help()`, `type()`, etc.

### practice_sets  
> Mixed practice sets.  

### projects **[WIP]**  
> Mini data anaylysis projects with real-world or industry-inspired context (currently in planning).  
> - Planned folder for future data analysis projects.
> - Currently empty and not yet added to the repository.

### kaggle-projects **[WIP]**  
> Real-world machine learning projects from Kaggle competitions (in progress).  
This folder includes structured project folders for hands-on practice using real competition datasets.  

#### titanic_survival_2025-07-18
> My first Kaggle challenge: **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**  
This project explores survival prediction on the Titanic based on passenger data. 

Progress so far:
- Built baseline model (`titanic_model_v1_2025-07-21.ipynb`) using TensorFlow Decision Forests
- Performed EDA (`eda_titanic_v1_based_on_raw_data_2025-07-21.ipynb`) on original dataset
- Created lightweight version for Kaggle submission: `titanic_model_v1_clean.ipynb`
- Achieved Kaggle public score: **0.80622**

*See `titanic_survival_2025-07-18/README.md` for detailed progress and documentation.*


More challenges will be added as I progress through my data science learning.

Thanks for visiting.  
I'll continue updating this portfolio with new learnings and projects.
