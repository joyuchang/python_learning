## Data Science Learning Portfolio
> This repository is a personal portfolio of my journey into the field of Data Science since 2025.
> I have a strong industry background across electronics and semiconductors with experience in business development and product delivery.
> Through Python and data projectes, I aim to transform domain knowledge into data-driven insights.

## Repository Structure

### `practice/`  
> Categorized learning notebooks for foundational Python, data structures, and logic
